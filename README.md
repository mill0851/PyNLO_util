# PyNLO_util
This python module and PyNLO simulation was created by me for use during my summer internship at The Ohio State University in the [LEAP](https://physics.osu.edu/leap) lab.

Utility functions for use with [PyNLO](https://github.com/pyNLO/PyNLO), a nonlinear optics simulator. Inside the examples directory these functions are used to simulate the YAG experiment in [this](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-21-23-28095&id=274338) paper. I have also included a jupyter notebook which explains what some of the fiber parameters used in the simulation are and how they should be calculated.

**NOTE**: PyNLO uses python 2.7 so you must have a 2.7 environment to run the example code. If you use VS Code, 2.7 is not supported, you will need to run the files from the terminal.
